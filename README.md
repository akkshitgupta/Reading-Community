#Introduction

## Reading Community
this is my first project ever. Reading Community is a plattform to connect local people who love to read so that they can get a companion for the journey ahead. Its like a library in online form.
Here they can connect, share their thoughts, and even the hard copies can be borrowed as locality is the main factor.
